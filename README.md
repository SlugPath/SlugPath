# Slug Path aka UCSC Course Planner

> A degree planner for UCSC students

## About

UCSC currently does not have an interactive and aesthetically pleasing degree planner that provides basic validation
for academic plans. Our aim with this project is to meet that demand in the student body, starting with the CSE department.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/fercevik729/UCSC-Course-Planner
pnpm install
npx prisma generate
```

Make sure to have the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` env variable set, along with any
other env variables if you choose to use Docker. Moreover, some additional env
variables are required at build time but not necessarily needed for local
development. You might want to set some mock values for these.

```
docker-compose --env-file=<your-env-file.env> up -d (optional)
pnpm init-db
```

This will initialize the database with the correct schema and initial data.
Finally run the project with

```
pnpm dev
```

Et VoilÃ ! The app should be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Contributing

After downloading the project files and the dependencies make sure to install
the necessary GitHooks for linting and formatting with

```
pnpm prepare
```

> To add your own Git Hooks beyond formatting or linting refer
> [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

Before running tests make sure that your local instance of the database contains
the up-to-date schema with

```
pnpx prisma migrate deploy
```

Make sure to add relevant tests and run them and view coverage details with

```
pnpm test
```

Before starting work on an issue make sure that it has not been assigned already
or has not been actively worked on recently. Create PR's onto the `dev` branch
upon completion of work, and we will review it and merge it as soon as possible.

### Credentials

Some features require access to sensitive credentials. We store these
credentials in a HashiCorp Vault. To access them start by creating a HC account
[here](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/). Then email your address to us
[here](mailto:fercevik@ucsc.edu). After getting access follow the steps below to
use the credentials:

1. Install hashicorp's `vlt`
2. `vlt login`
3. `vlt config init`
4. `vlt secrets get -plaintext {secret name}`

## Permissions

To set yourself as an admin in the database, run the following command to open psql. The connect string is in your .env file under `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`. This is useful to test permissions and major requirements editing.

```
psql "<connection string>"
```

Then run the following command to set yourself as an admin

```
UPDATE "User" SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = '<your-email>';
```

## Deployment

We use Vercel to deploy as it is the most convenient way to deploy a Next.js
application.

## Database Information

- To backup any existing data in a database use the
  `pg_dump "<connection string>" > outfile.sql` command
- To restore from backup use `psql "<connection string>" < outfile.sql`
- Make sure to create and deploy migrations whenever the schema is changed
