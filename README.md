# CSE 115A: UCSC Course Planner

> A course planner for UCSC CS/CE students

## About

UCSC currently does not have an interactive and aesthetically pleasing course planner that provides basic validation
for academic plans. Our aim with this project is to meet that demand in the student body, starting with the CSE
department.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/fercevik729/UCSC-Course-Planner
npm clean install
npx prisma generate
```

Make sure to have the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` env variable set, along with any other env variables if you choose to use Docker.

```
docker-compose --env-file=<your-env-file.env> up -d (optional)
npm run init-db
```

This will initialize the database with the correct schema and initial data.
Finally run the project with

```
npm run dev
```

Et VoilÃ ! The app should be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Contributing

After downloading the project files and the dependencies make sure to install the necessary GitHooks for linting and formatting with

```
npm run prepare

> To add your own Git Hooks beyond formatting or linting refer [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

Make sure to add relevant tests and run them and view coverage details with

```

Before running tests make sure that your local instance of the database contains the up-to-date schema with

```
npx prisma db push
```

Before starting work on an issue make sure that it has not been assigned already or has not been actively worked on recently.
Create PR's onto the `dev` branch upon completion of work, and we will review it and merge it as soon as possible.
